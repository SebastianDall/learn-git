# learn-git
Practice using git(hub)

# To-do
 - Clone this repository to your local machine, preferably using GitKraken
 - Make a branch for yourself named by your github account
 - Checkout the branch
 - Start doing some typical 16S work in the `analysis.Rmd` file
 - Add files along the way if necessary, fx data or other scripts
 - Adjust the `.gitignore` file if needed. Are there files/folders git should stop tracking?
 - Finish this `README.md` file removing the to-do section. You can use markdown syntax
 - Stage related changes together and commit them one by one with meaningful commit messages
 - Push changes
 - Make a pull request from your branch to the main branch with a description
 - Done
